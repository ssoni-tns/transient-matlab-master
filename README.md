# (Aarsnes and Shor, 2018) Transient Torsional Drillstring Model
Transient Torsional Drillstring Model, as published in :

Aarsnes, Ulf Jakob F., and Roman J. Shor. "Torsional vibrations with bit off bottom: Modeling, characterization and field data validation." Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering 163 (2018): 712-721.


## Documentation
The supplied model is written for Matlab (versions 2016 - 2021).  To run the code, run MAIN.m.

## Benchmarking
Limitations:
* Only torsional dynamics are considered
* The drillbit is off bottom
* There is continuous contact between the drillstring the borehole (soft string model assumption)

Test cases:
* Validation results are available in the referenced journal paper
